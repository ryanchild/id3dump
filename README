Title: id3dump

This directory contains a Tcl script for reading MP3 files and dumping the ID3
tags contained within. This script is an exercise in getting to know the Tool
Command Language (Tcl), specifically the following areas: 

- File I/O
- String formatting
- Binary scanning
- Lists
- Arrays
- Error handling

It is written to be compatible with the Tcl 8.4 interpreter. It has thus far
only been tested on Linux 32-bit. To run, simply type "./id3dump <filename>"
(without the quotes) from this directory at the command line, replacing
<filename> with the path to the MP3 file that contains the ID3 tags you would
like to dump. Alternatively, you may invoke the Tcl shell explicitly by typing
"tclsh id3dump <filename>"

The following references were consulted in writing this script:
